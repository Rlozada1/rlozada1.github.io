<h1>Sections 1-12</h1>
<p><b>Overview:</b> This sections work as an introducition into complex numbers, with definitions, applications, and visuals being given
</p>
<p> What is a complex number?
<p>A complex number is define as having two part: a real and imaginary parts. The real part is denoted by x while the imaginary part is defined by iy.
Together they are defined by the sum <i>z=x+iy</i>.</p>
<p>Another major concept in these first sections how complex numbers behave in terms of operations. What we find is that complex numbers behave similiar to regular
intergers. The concept of graphing is also spoken of which turns out to be easier with the definition given of a complex number(i.e the real axis is the x axis and the imaginay axis is the y axis)

<h2>Sections 13-30</h2>
<p><b>Overview:</b>Moving on from the introductions we know start to learn the calculus of complex numbers. We essentially take what we know and apply it in terms complex analysis.</p>
<p> Complex analysis in terms of derivatives is fairly simple. The same rules and methods apply to complex numbers although the derivatives must be taken for both real and imaginary parts seperately</p>
<p> Most of these sections focus on more indepth analysis of complex numbers. It includes breakdowns on the real and imaginary parts of a complex numbers to show how each part contributes to the overall concept</p>

<h3>Sections 31-Midterm Week(Section 33)</h3>
<p><b>Overview:</b> A shift from derivatives into Logorathim functions.</p>
<p>Before the midterm the log function in complex analysis is given. It involves the use of the unit circle/
<p> Formula is logz=ln|z|+(theta+2npi)
